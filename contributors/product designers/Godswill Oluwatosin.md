MINOR FIXES ON TEAM LEAD'S REQUEST
I also worked on some minor fixes of some pages on the high-Fidelity designs on request of the Team Lead which were not assigned on Github like the redesign of the Logo Used, remodification of the preview page and adding a save name iput field and button.

LOGO
I Helped to draw up a new logo to suit the project niche better.

SAVE NAME INPUT AND BUTTON
I also added the save name button and input fields to all the generation pages on reuest of the team lead to allow users save their favicons with recognized names

PREVIEW PAGE POP-UP
For the preview page, the team lead suggested it be a pop-up overlay on the generation page, rather than being a separate page entirely. Here's a screenshot
