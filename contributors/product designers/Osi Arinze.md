LINKS TO THE ALL THE SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES I RESOLVED AND HOW THEY WERE RESOLVED AS WELL AS SOME SCREENSHOTS OF RESOLVED ISSUES

Research plan and Interview script#13:  The user research plan and Interview script were actually designed by 5 of the team members in which I was among. We solved this issue by coming together using Google meet where the 5 of us brainstormed together and tried to understand the project more since the entirety of the project depends on this particular task. The link to the research plan and Interview script is also attached below.

Create User Persona#8:  I was also saddled with the task of creating a fictional character which  represents a user type (target users) . This helped the team  to create understanding and empathy with the end-users, thus helping us to define expectations, concerns and motivations, helping the design team to understand how to design a product that will satisfy our users' needs and therefore be a success. 
Here's a screenshot to the user persona I created and the link to the file

create tutorial video#17 : I specifically created the tutorial video for our Favicon generator using Canva, this was in order to give users a comprehensive walk through of how the Favicon generator works without experiencing any difficulty. The idea to use a video was collectively accepted by the team and I was saddled with the responsibility to come up with the tutorial video.  Below are the screenshots of some pages of the video and immediately after the screenshots is the  link to watch the video directly on canva.
