1. Using figma, I created buttons (check boxes and radio buttons especially) on the style guide page. Its default, active, inactive states as would be applied in the design.

2. On the low fidelity/ wireframe and high fidelity pages,I designed the login and register page as I was assigned. This included creating the active screen, the error screen, the forget password screen amongst others as well as ensuring this designs were responsive.
